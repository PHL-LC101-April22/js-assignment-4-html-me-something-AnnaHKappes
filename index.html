      <h1 id="mainHeading">My Journey To Be A JavaScript Coder</h1>

      <main>
         <P id="begining">With a little background of taking a class of Visual Basic language in college back in 2005, JavaScript is my fresh start to learn a new programming language. It was not easy, yet interesting and exciting journey. So far, I have learned so much, beyond my initial expectations, and I am so proud of myself.</P>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Process Of Learning </h2>
            <P id="testP" class="funParagraph">There were times I felt frustrated when I could not figure out why my codes not running. It took lots of time to figure out that missing curling bracket or my misspelling. There were also times I felt unconfident when I read the whole chapter and thought I understood it, however, I still had difficult on doing exercises and studios. Through the journey, besides learning JavaScript, I think I am learning how to handle my frustration, calm myself and ride up. When a problem is solved by me, the moments of joy and confidence is very awarding, making the whole problem-solving journey worthy.</P>
